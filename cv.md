# About Me

Having started my work as laboratory technician of a road laboratory, I have mastered the skills of working with different types of laboratory equipment.
My keen interest in working with research data led me to work as the head of a laboratory at a federal university, where I continued to self-learning, examining the process of collecting and processing data for subsequent analysis and research.

One year ago I've become passionate about Data Analysis and Macine Learning. I've mastered some techniques, learned to work with Python and libraries for Data Analysis, become an advanced Excel user and found new job as project-manager of an intelligent transport system.
